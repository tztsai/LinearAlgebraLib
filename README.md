# Linear-Algebra

Features:

- Various operations on vectors and matrices: dot product, matrix multiplication,
  matrix inverse, etc.
- Do Gauss-Jordan elimination and return the operation matrix:
  - Has an option of whether to execute the back substitution. If yes, transform
    the matrix into its $rref$ form; otherwise simply transform it into upper triangular.
  - has an option to print the detailed steps. You can choose to display the              intermediate matrices and explanations of each row operation. You can also choose     to print their corresponding LaTeX code, which reduces your linear algebra homework   into a copy-and-paste affair!
  - LaTeX code output example: ![latex_code_gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TZTsai/Linear-Algebra/master/bc0sh-a2mrp.gif)
- Solve a linear system by various means:
    The Gauss-Jordan method, the back-substitution method, iterative methods to get approximate solutions etc.
- More to be appended.
